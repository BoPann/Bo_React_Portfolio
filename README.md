## HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS, emailJS API

This serves as a platform where I showcase my skills, display the projects I've worked on, and provide a means for people to reach out to me. Building this project has been an incredible learning experience in website development. It has honed my skills in various aspects, including web design (covering layout, style, structure, and responsiveness), decision-making on tools and frameworks, and implementation. My proficiency in ReactJS has notably improved, especially in understanding component structure and utilizing state management with hooks. I've also become more adept at working with CSS and HTML, with hands-on experience encompassing aspects like padding, flexbox, and animations. Additionally, I've enhanced my proficiency in handling APIs, involving tasks such as managing API keys, tokens, and making requests, like the integration of emailJS for contact functionality. Furthermore, my grasp of JavaScript, particularly in working with asynchronous operations through async/await functions, has grown significantly.
