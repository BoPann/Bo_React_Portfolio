          <h3 className="projectDetails">
            There were two moments that really sparked my inspiration for creating this application. First, during a road trip, I found myself struggling to come up with a playlist, and it got me thinking about how convenient it would be to have an app that keeps me updated with the latest songs. The second moment was when I realized I was unfamiliar with the songs playing in a friend's car, and they were all the latest hits. That's when the idea solidified â€“ I wanted to develop an app that not only helps me create playlists of the freshest tunes but also lets me explore songs from the past, almost like time traveling through music trends!

            This personal website project has been a substantial undertaking for me. It serves as a platform where I showcase my skills, display the projects I've worked on, and provide a means for people to reach out to me. Building this project has been an incredible learning experience in website development. It has honed my skills in various aspects, including web design (covering layout, style, structure, and responsiveness), decision-making on tools and frameworks, and implementation. My proficiency in ReactJS has notably improved, especially in understanding component structure and utilizing state management with hooks. I've also become more adept at working with CSS and HTML, with hands-on experience encompassing aspects like padding, flexbox, and animations. Additionally, I've enhanced my proficiency in handling APIs, involving tasks such as managing API keys, tokens, and making requests, exemplified by the integration of emailJS for contact functionality. Furthermore, my grasp of JavaScript, particularly in working with asynchronous operations through async/await functions, has grown significantly.
